# Artimon

Artimon is a decentralised application that lets you generate unique monsters (Artimons) with the help of AI which can then be minted as NFTs.

## Website

https://artimon.web.app/

## The challenge

The challenge was to create a website which makes it possible to bring monsters generated by a machine learning model onto the Ethereum blockchain in the form of NFTs and display all Aritmons with their corresponding owner.


## The result

I built a React dApp which uses a Tensorflow model to generate unique Artimons. Artimons can then be minted as NFTs via the MetaMask wallet. Furthermore the data of all Artimons ever minted is read from the Ethereum blockchain and displayed in the form of the Artidex.
